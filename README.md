soundscape is a webGL + webAudioAPI platform on which you can record sounds in a 3D space to build and navigate your custom soundscape.

i use it mainly to make interactive songs for my own amusement, but it can be used for anything that involves sound + space. 

you need a recording device (microphone, or any other input device) and a pair of headphones to enjoy the experience. 

also a quiet place to sit is key so you don't get any environment sounds in the recordings. 

you can try it for yourself in here https://martucol.github.io/soundscape/ :sparkles:
